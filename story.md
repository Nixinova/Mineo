# Planned Mineo storyline

2318\. You are contracted by the government to collect rock samples from before the great extinction around 65 million years ago. You are transported back 65.3 million years, 20 years before the asteroid hits, to collect information about both the geology of the world back then and of the impending doom. Of course, when the asteroid nears, you'll be transported back home safely in your time machine. But, conveniently, your time machine is destroyed on impact as you travel back to the time of dinosaurs. You must survive the next 10 years and solve puzzles to gather enough materials to rebuild your time machine and get back home safely.
